This is an expense tracker webapp made by me :)

Built on the next.js framework with Clerk authentication and neondb database.

This project will soon be continued as the bar chart and other improvements are yet to be made

To install this simply do these steps : 
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with npm install
3. Configure environment variables ( Clerk auth and Neondb database)
4. Generate and migrate the schema
5. Run the project with npm run dev
